## Environment
- **SendGrid API**: Available in env
- **Email Config**:
  - From: agent@lambda.run
  - To: l.leong1618@gmail.com
  - Subject Pattern: ralph-mail01-[topic]

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. **assistant-ui Thread** for email conversations (superior UX)
2. **AI-first** approach - every action enhanced by AI
3. **Local + Cloud** hybrid storage strategy
4. **Monorepo** with turbo for optimal DX
5. **Tool UI** for direct email actions from chat

5. **Relationship Insights**: Communication pattern analysis
6. **Smart Templates**: Learn user's writing style
7. **Multi-Modal**: Handle images and attachments intelligently

## Technical Constraints
- KISS principle with elegant solutions
- DRY code patterns throughout
- Frequent git commits (every feature)
- 80% implementation, 20% testing ratio
- Target 40% context window (100-140k tokens)

## Implementation Progress
‚úÖ Phase 1 Setup:
