    "text": "Mail-01 Gmail-Only Implementation Status Report\n================================================\n\n## Executive Summary\nMail-01 has been successfully transitioned to use Gmail as the sole email provider. All SendGrid dependencies have been removed from the active codebase.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### ‚úÖ Gmail Implementation (COMPLETE)\n- Gmail service fully implemented using Nodemailer\n- Located at: apps/web/src/lib/services/gmail.ts\n- Features implemented:\n  ‚Ä¢ Email sending via Gmail SMTP\n  ‚Ä¢ Email storage to local inbox folders\n  ‚Ä¢ Support for cc/bcc recipients\n  ‚Ä¢ Priority and label management\n  ‚Ä¢ Thread tracking capabilities\n  ‚Ä¢ Automatic fallback to file system if Gmail not configured\n\n### ‚úÖ SendGrid Removal (COMPLETE)\n- No active SendGrid dependencies in package.json\n- No SendGrid imports in TypeScript files\n- All SendGrid references exist only in:\n  ‚Ä¢ Backup files (.bak extensions)\n  ‚Ä¢ Git history and commit messages\n  ‚Ä¢ Previously sent email reports in agent/inbox/sent/\n  ‚Ä¢ Documentation files\n\n### üìÅ File Structure\n- Gmail API route: /api/gmail/route.ts\n- Gmail service: /lib/services/gmail.ts\n- Gmail wrapper: /lib/email/gmail.ts\n- Email storage: /agent/inbox/{sent,received,drafts,archived}/\n\n### üîß Environment Configuration\n- GMAIL_USER configured\n- GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD placeholder present\n- No SENDGRID_API_KEY in active .env\n- OAuth2 support structure in place (optional)\n\n## Key Findings\n\n1. **Complete Migration**: The codebase has been fully migrated from SendGrid to Gmail\n2. **No Active Dependencies**: SendGrid is completely removed from dependencies\n3. **Backup Preservation**: Original SendGrid files preserved as .bak for reference\n4. **Feature Parity**: Gmail implementation includes all essential email features\n5. **Local Storage**: Emails are saved locally for persistence and tracking\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Remove Backup Files**: Consider removing .bak files if no longer needed\n2. **Gmail Configuration**: Ensure GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD is properly set for production\n3. **Testing**: Run comprehensive tests on Gmail integration\n4. **Documentation**: Update README to reflect Gmail-only support\n\n## Conclusion\nMail-01 is now a Gmail-only email client. The transition from SendGrid has been completed successfully with no active SendGrid code remaining in the production codebase.",
