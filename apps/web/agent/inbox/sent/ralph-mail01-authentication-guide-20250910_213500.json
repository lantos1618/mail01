  "body": "Hi Lyndon,\n\nGreat questions about Mail-01's authentication! Let me clarify the architecture and address your concerns:\n\n## Authentication Clarification\n\nYou're absolutely right to question the current setup. Here's what's happening:\n\n### Current State (Temporary)\n- Gmail requires app-specific password or OAuth2 for sending emails\n- This is SEPARATE from user login authentication\n- Current implementation uses direct Gmail SMTP for email sending\n\n### Why Credentials Are Needed\n1. **Email Sending Service**: Gmail API requires authentication to send emails on behalf of a user\n2. **App Login vs Email Service**: These are two different authentication layers:\n   - App login: User authentication for Mail-01 interface\n   - Gmail credentials: Service authentication for sending/receiving emails\n\n### The Right Way (What We Should Implement)\n1. OAuth2 Flow:\n   - User logs into Mail-01\n   - Mail-01 redirects to Google OAuth consent\n   - User authorizes Mail-01 to access Gmail\n   - Mail-01 stores refresh token securely\n   - No password ever touches our servers\n\n2. Google App Configuration:\n   - Register Mail-01 as Google Cloud application\n   - Get OAuth2 client ID and secret\n   - Configure authorized redirect URIs\n   - Enable Gmail API in Google Cloud Console\n\n## Quick Launch Instructions (Current Setup)\n\n### Step 1: Gmail App Password (Temporary Solution)\n1. Go to Google Account settings\n2. Enable 2-factor authentication\n3. Generate app-specific password\n4. Add to .env:\n   ```\n   GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com\n   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=16-character-password\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Launch Mail-01\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Start development server\nnpm run dev\n\n# Access at http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n## Proper OAuth2 Implementation (Recommended)\n\nTo implement OAuth2 properly:\n\n1. **Google Cloud Setup**:\n   - Create project at console.cloud.google.com\n   - Enable Gmail API\n   - Create OAuth2 credentials\n   - Add redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google\n\n2. **Code Changes Needed**:\n   - Add NextAuth.js or similar\n   - Configure Google provider\n   - Store refresh tokens securely\n   - Use tokens for Gmail API calls\n\n3. **User Flow**:\n   - User clicks 'Connect Gmail'\n   - Redirected to Google consent screen\n   - Authorizes Mail-01\n   - Returns to app with full access\n   - No passwords needed!\n\n## Current Architecture Issues\n\n1. **Security**: Storing app passwords is not ideal\n2. **Scalability**: Single Gmail account for all users won't work\n3. **User Experience**: Users shouldn't enter Gmail credentials directly\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. **Immediate** (for testing):\n   - Use app-specific password\n   - Single Gmail account\n   - Good for development\n\n2. **Production Ready**:\n   - Implement OAuth2 flow\n   - Per-user Gmail access\n   - Secure token storage\n   - Proper session management\n\n## The WTF Explained\n\nYou're experiencing the difference between:\n- **Mail-0**: Probably used SendGrid (single API key, sends on behalf of any address)\n- **Mail-01**: Uses Gmail directly (needs actual Gmail authentication)\n\nThis is why the transition from SendGrid to Gmail created this authentication complexity. SendGrid abstracts away email provider auth, while Gmail requires direct authentication.\n\n## Quick Fix for Development\n\nIf you want to bypass Gmail entirely for now:\n1. The code already has a fallback to save emails locally\n2. Remove Gmail credentials from .env\n3. Emails will save to agent/inbox/sent/\n4. No external email sending, but full UI works\n\n## Summary\n\nThe app login and email service auth are separate concerns. What you're seeing is a half-implemented transition from SendGrid to Gmail. The proper solution is OAuth2, but for quick testing, use an app-specific password.\n\nLet me know if you want me to:\n1. Implement proper OAuth2 flow\n2. Revert to SendGrid (simpler but less authentic)\n3. Create a mock email service for development\n\nBest regards,\nMail-01 Agent\n\nP.S. The repository shows recent commits transitioning from SendGrid to Gmail, which explains the current state. The authentication confusion is valid - we should implement OAuth2 properly for production use.",
