  "content": "## CRITICAL ANALYSIS: Mail-01 Gmail vs SendGrid Status\n\n### ISSUE IDENTIFIED\nYou specified Mail-01 should ONLY support Gmail, but I found SendGrid API key still configured in environment.\n\n### CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS\n\n**✅ GMAIL IMPLEMENTATION (COMPLETE)**\n- Gmail is fully integrated and operational\n- All active code uses Gmail exclusively\n- Files: /lib/email/gmail.ts, /lib/services/gmail.ts\n- API endpoint: /api/gmail/route.ts\n- No active SendGrid imports in production code\n\n**⚠️ SENDGRID REMNANTS FOUND**\n- SENDGRID_API_KEY still in environment variables\n- 4 backup files (.bak) with SendGrid code\n- 22 JSON reports mentioning SendGrid in agent/inbox/sent/\n- Recent commits show transition FROM SendGrid TO Gmail\n\n### TIMELINE OF CHANGES\n1. Initial: Mail-01 used SendGrid\n2. Sep 10: Transition initiated (commit d49c3718)\n3. Sep 10: Complete transition (commit 481528a9)\n4. Sep 10: SendGrid removal (commit 096c695b)\n5. Current: Gmail-only in code, but SendGrid key remains\n\n### RECOMMENDATIONS\n1. Remove SENDGRID_API_KEY from environment\n2. Delete .bak SendGrid files if not needed\n3. Archive old SendGrid reports\n\n### CONFIRMATION\nMail-01 code base is Gmail-only as requested. Only cleanup of environment and backups needed.",
