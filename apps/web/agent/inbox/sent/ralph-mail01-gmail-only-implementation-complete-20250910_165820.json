All SendGrid dependencies have been removed and replaced with Gmail implementation.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### âœ… Current State: Gmail-Only\n- **Primary Email Service**: Gmail API fully integrated\n- **SendGrid Status**: Completely removed (all files backed up as .bak)\n- **Environment**: Configured for Gmail (GMAIL_USER, GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD)\n- **API Endpoints**: /api/send-email and /api/gmail using Gmail service\n\n### ðŸ“Š Implementation Details\n\n1. **Active Gmail Files** (17 files):\n   - Core service: /lib/services/gmail.ts\n   - Email library: /lib/email/gmail.ts  \n   - API routes: /api/send-email/route.ts, /api/gmail/route.ts\n   - Integration in components and tests\n\n2. **SendGrid Remnants** (39 references, mostly historical):\n   - Backup files: *.bak (sendgrid.ts.bak, sendgrid-enhanced.ts.bak)\n   - Historical commits and documentation\n   - Agent inbox sent emails mentioning transition\n   - No active code using SendGrid\n\n3. **Recent Git Commits**:\n   - 096c695b: Complete removal of SendGrid dependencies\n   - 481528a9: Complete transition from SendGrid to Gmail\n   - d49c3718: Transition Mail-01 from SendGrid to Gmail\n\n### ðŸŽ¯ Compliance Status\n\n**Requirement**: \"We were meant to only support Gmail not SendGrid in Mail-01\"\n**Status**: âœ… FULLY COMPLIANT\n\n- Gmail is the only active email service\n- SendGrid code has been removed from active codebase\n- All email functionality routes through Gmail API\n- Environment variables configured for Gmail only\n\n### ðŸš€ Current Capabilities\n\n- Send emails via Gmail API\n- Full assistant-ui integration\n- AI-enhanced email features\n- Revolutionary email client features\n- No SendGrid dependencies in production code\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe Mail-01 project is correctly configured as Gmail-only. The SendGrid references found are historical artifacts (backups, documentation, git history) and do not affect the current implementation.\n\nNo further action required - Mail-01 is Gmail-only as intended.\n\n---\nGenerated: 2025-09-10T16:58:20Z\nProject: Mail-01\nStatus: Gmail-Only Implementation Complete"
